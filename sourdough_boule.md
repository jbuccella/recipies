#### Levain Ingredients ####

Mix the levain and let sit in a warm part of your house (**26 degrees celsius is best**) until doubled in size (roughly 5 hours)


## Main Dough ##

**With 1.5 hours remaining until Levain is ready, begin autolysing your dough.**

Mix together that main dough ingredients until all of the flour and salt has been combined with the water, into a shaggy mass. Do not kneed.  

#### Main Dough Ingredients ####
* 315g Unbleached Bread Flour
* 100g Red Wheat Flour

## Making the Dough ##
**When levain is ready, mix 90 grams of levain into the dough, and mix until fully combined**

To do this, pour the levain evenly over the main dough, and press your fingers through the levain and into the dough to evenly distribute the levain into the dough. Then mix together until both the main dough and the levain are incorporated.
